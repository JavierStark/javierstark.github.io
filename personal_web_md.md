## 🌐 About Me
Computer Engineering student at the University of Málaga with a strong focus on scalable backend development, cloud architectures, and the emerging intersection between computing and life sciences.

My work emphasizes robust engineering practices—TDD, CI/CD, clean code, refactoring, and architectural clarity—to build production-ready systems. I've deployed full‑stack applications to Azure and Oracle Cloud, always prioritizing maintainability, performance, and reliability.

Currently, I’m expanding into **bioinformatics and synthetic biology** as a member of **iGEM UMA**, complementing my **research internship at Karunya University**, where I built a cloud-backed EEG processing pipeline for epilepsy prediction using deep learning.

I thrive in fast-paced, competitive environments, having twice won the **Ada Byron Regional Programming Tournament** and receiving awards at **Malackathon** and **Málaga Jam** for software quality, innovation, and rapid development under pressure.

I also value leadership and community: as **President of IAESTE Computer Science Málaga**, I help students access international opportunities and cultivate a collaborative tech ecosystem.
